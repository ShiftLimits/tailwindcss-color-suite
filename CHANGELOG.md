## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add testing for Tailwind

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Replace `configureColors` function with `tailwindColors` function that only takes a Color Suite config object and returns the tailwind equivalent. It moves the require of the `colors.config.js` file into the tailwind config file
  - This approach allows Tailwind to track the `colors.config.js` file as a dependency with its JIT engine which means no more full page refresh when making CRUD changes to the color palette ðŸŽ‰
- Made package dependency-free by establishing proper peer dependencies and bundling all application dependencies into the build
- Target a minimum version of Tailwind CSS v3

### Fixed
- Prevent error when updating root variables after hot update by maintaining our own stylesheet

## [0.3.1] - 2021-10-12

### Added
- Add setting for adding CSS `inherit` value to palette

### Changed
- Patch root variables directly using stylesheet rather than polluting the HTML element

### Fixed
- Don't join current working directory to config path if the passed config path is absolute.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-09-16

Initial public release! Third refactor.
